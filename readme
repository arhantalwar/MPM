My Project Maker

Imagine you have an idea you want to work on, like just want to work on it and not actually do the boiler plate stuff like

cd this_is_where_i_have_my_projects_at/
mkdir what_should_i_name_my_project/
cd what_should_i_name_my_project/
git init
curl -u git_username:git_token and god know what more...

You get it right?


#### HOW TO SET THINGS UP #####

Start off by editing the mpm.conf file

1) Add the path to your dir where you have you projects at.
2) Add your github username
